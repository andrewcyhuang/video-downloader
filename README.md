## About Video Downloader

Video Downloader is a desktop app that provides an elegant GUI for the youtube-dl open-source command-line program to download videos from YouTube.com and many other sites.

Video Downloader is built with a React front-end, Redux for state management, wrapped up with electron into a simple, elegant desktop application.

### How It Works

Just input a valid url from one of the supported websites and let the magic happen!

Video-downloader is still a work in progress, however feel free to check out my work so far:

clone the repo and run these commands in the root directory:
